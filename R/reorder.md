Reorder those bars, once and for all, with **forcats**

Since I happened to be preparing to teach, among other things, *how to
reorder the bars in a bar chart* when I saw Claus Wilke’s response, I
figured this would be a good topic for a tutorial.

My theory is that this is a troublesome topic because several different
problems are conflated into one question. If, however, you first
identify *how* you want the bars ordered, and *why* they are not
ordered, the road will be less rocky. And with
[**forcats**](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/) (now a core
[**tidyverse**](tidyverse.org) package) functions – namely,
`fct_inorder()`, `fct_relevel()`, `fct_reorder()`, and `fct_infreq()` –
it will become second nature to get the order of the bars right.

Before getting into reordering, it’s important to understand R defaults,
which happen to be the same for base R and **ggplot2**. For *factor*
data, the default is for the bars to be plotted in the order of the
factor levels. This applies to *ordered* and *non-ordered* factors–*all*
types of factors have ordered levels. *Character* data, in contrast, is
plotted in alphabetical order by default. Check what you have with
`str()`.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
mycolor <- "#002448"; myfill = "#7192E3"

df <- tibble(chardata = c("cold", "warm", "hot", "hot", "warm", "warm", "cold", "cold", "cold"), 
    factordata = factor(c("cold", "warm", "hot", "hot", "warm", "warm", "cold", "cold", "cold"), 
                                 levels = c("cold", "warm", "hot")))

head(df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##   chardata factordata
    ##   <chr>    <fct>     
    ## 1 cold     cold      
    ## 2 warm     warm      
    ## 3 hot      hot       
    ## 4 hot      hot       
    ## 5 warm     warm      
    ## 6 warm     warm

In the examples below, all of the reordering happens in the calls to
`ggplot2`, which means that you don’t have to alter your data at all to
achieve the desired effect. In fact, you don’t even have to have to
convert your character data to factor data before plotting. The
**forcats** functions will perform the conversion for plotting purposes
only. However, if you prefer to change the data itself, of course, you
can. See the U.S. births example below for an example on how to do so.

Now, there are two key rules to follow when deciding how to reorder bars
in a bar chart:

### 1\. Bars should appear in their natural order, if they have one.

If the levels or categories have a natural order to them (a.k.a. ordinal
data), they should be plotted in that order. However, unless specified
otherwise, whether your categories are stored as factor or character
data, they will appear in alphabetical order in a bar chart (unless you
changed around the levels of the factors).

In this example, the levels have a natural order, from Beginner to
Expert, that is not reflected in the
plot:

``` r
mydf <- tibble(Skill = c("Beginner", "Adv Beginner", "Intermediate", "Expert"),
               Num = c(75, 60, 15, 25))

ggplot(mydf, aes(Skill, Num)) + 
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The simplest way to get the order right depends on the situation at
hand:

#### (a) The row order is correct (data is binned*)

* = has a count or frequency column, in this case, `Num`

In this case, we can simply indicate with `fct_inorder()` that we want
the levels to be plotted in the order in which they appear in the data
frame:

``` r
mydf
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 2
    ##   Skill          Num
    ##   <chr>        <dbl>
    ## 1 Beginner        75
    ## 2 Adv Beginner    60
    ## 3 Intermediate    15
    ## 4 Expert          25

Since the row order in the data frame is correct, it’s a simple fix:

``` r
ggplot(mydf, aes(fct_inorder(Skill), Num)) + 
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

#### (b) Only one category is out of order (data is binned*)

* = has a count or frequency column, in this case, `Num`

Often there’s just one level out of order. In the case below it’s “Under
15 years”, which should be the first category in the chart, not the
last:

``` r
# 2015 U.S. Births
MotherAge <-  c("15-19 years", "20-24 years", "25-29 years", 
                "30-34 years", "35-39 years", "40-44 years",
                "45-49 years", "50 years and over", "Under 15 years")

Num <- c(229.715, 850.509, 1152.311, 1094.693, 527.996, 111.848,
            8.171, .754, 2.500)

Births2015 <- tibble(MotherAge, Num)

ggplot(Births2015, aes(MotherAge, Num)) + 
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + 
  ggtitle("United States Births, 2015", subtitle = "in thousands") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1250, 250)) +
  coord_flip() + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can use `fct_relevel()` to move it where it needs to
go:

``` r
ggplot(Births2015, aes(fct_relevel(MotherAge, "Under 15 years"), Num)) + 
  ggtitle("United States Births, 2015", subtitle = "in thousands") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1250, 250)) +
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + coord_flip() + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Although we can move the levels around without touching the original
data, in this case, we probably do want to change the levels to the
correct natural order and then plot, as follows:

``` r
Births2015 <- Births2015 %>%
  mutate(MotherAge = fct_relevel(MotherAge, "Under 15 years"))

ggplot(Births2015, aes(MotherAge, Num)) + 
  ggtitle("United States Births, 2015", subtitle = "in thousands") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1250, 250)) +
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + coord_flip() + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

#### (c) Many categories are out of order

As long as the categories that are out of order all need to be moved to
the same place, we can use the same technique:

``` r
x <- factor(c("A", "B", "C", "move1", "D", "E", "move2", "F"))
x
```

    ## [1] A     B     C     move1 D     E     move2 F    
    ## Levels: A B C D E F move1 move2

``` r
fct_relevel(x, "move1", "move2")   # move to the beginning (default)
```

    ## [1] A     B     C     move1 D     E     move2 F    
    ## Levels: move1 move2 A B C D E F

``` r
fct_relevel(x, "move1", "move2", after = 4) # move after the fourth item
```

    ## [1] A     B     C     move1 D     E     move2 F    
    ## Levels: A B C D move1 move2 E F

``` r
fct_relevel(x, "move1", "move2", after = Inf) # move to the end
```

    ## [1] A     B     C     move1 D     E     move2 F    
    ## Levels: A B C D E F move1 move2

However, if they’re all in a big jumble, the only solution is to
manually reorder all of the levels with `fct_relevel()`.

Some important notes:

  - This problem has nothing to do with any other variable. There is
    simply a mismatch between the levels of the factors and the natural
    order of the categories.

  - Don’t be tempted to use ordered factors even though your data has
    ordered levels. The levels are ordered for *all* factors.

### 2\. Otherwise, bars should be ordered by frequency count.

Ordering by frequency count is the recommended approach for nominal
data, that is, categories that are not naturally ordered.

#### (a) Using `geom_col()`(binned data)

Once again, the default is for the bars to be ordered alphabetically,
which is not what we want. (Since the bar chart is horizontal the
categories are alphabetical from bottom to
top.)

``` r
weekend_gross <- tibble(movie = c("Jumanji", "Maze Runner", "Winchester",
                        "The Greatest Snowman", "The Post"),
              gross = c(10.93, 10.475, 9.307, 7.696, 5.218))

ggplot(weekend_gross, aes(movie, gross)) + 
  ggtitle("Weekend Box Office", subtitle = "Feb 2-4, 2018") + 
  ylab("millions of dollars") +
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + coord_flip() + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This issue can be addressed within the call to `ggplot()` with
`fct_reorder()`, also from **forcats**; we do not have to actually
reorder the factor levels.

``` r
# note the change in the first line:
ggplot(weekend_gross, aes(fct_reorder(movie, gross), gross)) +  
  ggtitle("Weekend Box Office", subtitle = "Feb 2-4, 2018") + 
  ylab("millions of dollars") +
  geom_col(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) + coord_flip() + theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Notes:

  - Although it appears that the bars are ordered from highest to lowest
    frequency count, in fact, they are ordered from lowest to highest,
    and plotted from the bottom up in a horizontal bar chart. If you
    need to reverse the order, you can add a minus sign to the variable
    which determines the order: `fct_reorder(movie, -gross)` or use
    `fct_reorder(movie, gross) %>% fct_rev()`.

#### (b) Using `geom_bar()` – data is unbinned

In this case, we can’t order by another variable since we only have one
variable: a list of categories:

``` r
unbinned <- tibble(response = sample(c("yes", "no", "maybe"), 100, 
                                     replace = TRUE, prob = c(.5, .15, .35)))

ggplot(unbinned, aes(response)) + geom_bar(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) +
  theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Again the bars are ordered alphabetically by default, not in order of
frequency. The solution is our fourth **forcats** function,
`fct_infreq()`:

``` r
ggplot(unbinned, aes(fct_infreq(response))) + geom_bar(color = mycolor, fill = myfill) +
  theme_grey(14)
```

<img src="reorder_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that `fct_infreq()` orders the levels in *decreasing* order of
frequency, ideal for drawing bar charts (presumably not a coincidence).
