```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.height = 3.5,
                      fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center',
                      warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      cache = TRUE)
```

1. Tidyverse is not a package.
2. Chunk Output Inline vs. Chunk Output in Console (= Plots in Plot Window)
3. Size figures with fig.height and fig.width
4. Not all packages are on CRAN. Go-to today: devtools::install_github
5. ::
6. If data doesn't appear,use data()
7. Compiling to pdf / Word
8. Don't get fancy in rmarkdown
